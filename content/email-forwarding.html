Instead of giving out your one address to everybody, create new forwarding addresses easily to give instead, and they’ll all send the emails you get to the same place for you. This gives you much better security, privacy and control over your email. If the company you give the alias to has a breach, you can just replace the alias instead of your whole darn email. If the service you give it to spams and won’t stop, you can easily cut ties right then and there. You can compartmentalize by using different emails for different things, keeping your online profiles from being tied together. Simple Login actually checks all the right boxes: free, open source, easy to use, and bug-free. You can also check out Anonaddy for similar (though slightly harder to use) option, and guerrillamail for temporary emails.

            Seriously, I can’t recommend this enough. First off, they have a really well designed and well functioning app, which is way more than I can say for other email forwarding/disposal email out there. Most are web-based. Secondly, and most importantly, they have privacy and security focused policy. And get this: they don’t paywall essential features. You could literally use it for free. Their premium plan is only $2.99/month, less than a cup of coffee. Please, please, please spread the words if you can. And support if you can. Thanks to everyone at SimpleLogin.<br>

            This has been great so far. I received all my forwarding emails without a problem. I like the option to turn off aliases when I want. I like the option to add notes to aliases. I wish the free version allow you to create more aliases continuously- like only 2 per week. I hate that you’re block from creating new alias unless you sign up for premium. If I find another (freemium) service that allows that, I’ll move.<br>

            Now i can have the alias forwarded to whichever mailbox i want. On top of that you can use this to hide your actual email address in case of subscribing services, and can destroy the alias if too may spam emails received. This is really awesome.<br>

            You’ve just found the right way to do email my friend! Instead of giving out your one address to everybody, create new forwarding addresses easily to give instead, and they’ll all send the emails you get to the same place for you. This gives you much better security, privacy and control over your email. If the company you give the alias to has a breach, you can just replace the alias instead of your whole darn email. If the service you give it to spams and won’t stop, you can easily cut ties right then and there. You can compartmentalize by using different emails for different things, keeping your online profiles from being tied together. Simple Login actually checks all the right boxes: free, open source, easy to use, and bug-free. You can also check out Anonaddy for similar (though slightly harder to use) option, and guerrillamail for temporary emails. Was recommended to me by YouTube channel Techlore, glad to know about this criminally underrated app.<br>

                    Absolutely! If one of your alias is getting too much emails for your taste, you can <strong>simply deactivate your alias</strong>. Once deactivated, your alias will stop forwarding emails to your inbox.

                    Yes! Our feature called <a href="https://simplelogin.io/blog/reverse-alias/">“reverse alias”</a> allows you to <strong>reply to any forwarded email</strong> while keeping your email address masked to the recipient.<br><br>

                    When you reply to an email forwarded by your alias, <strong>SimpleLogin redirects your response back to the original sender and replace your real email address with the email alias</strong> known by the sender. That way, you never reveal your real email address and your identity.

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_forwarding">Email forwarding</a> means sending a received email message to additional recipients. When an email is forwarded, the original recipient's address and any other addresses in the "To:" or "Cc:" fields of the original email will be removed, replaced by the new recipient's address. The initial sender's address remains in the "From:" field.

          <div class="mb-3">At SimpleLogin, we understand the importance of <strong>protecting your personal information</strong> especially when it comes to your email address. As the founder of SimpleLogin, I wanted to share why I believe it is important to use private email forwarding when registering on a new website.
          </div>

          <div class="mb-3">
            When registering for a new website, companies often collect a lot of personal information. <strong>Email addresses are especially prone to being shared with third-party companies and advertisers</strong>, leading to unwanted and intrusive emails. By using private email forwarding, you can ensure that your personal email address is kept hidden and your inbox remains uncluttered.
          </div>

          <div class="mb-3">Having a <strong>unique and anonymous email address</strong> also protects you from fraud and other malicious intent. It is a necessary step that you should take in order to remain safe and secure online.</div>

          <div class="mb-3">SimpleLogin is a <a href="/">private email aliasing tool</a> that makes it possible for you to have a unique and secure email address when signing up for a new website or service. Our tool also allows you to personalize and customize your email address, giving you the ability to make sure it fits your own personal needs and preferences.</div>

          <div class="mb-3">We understand that when it comes to your personal data, it is important to stay safe and secure. I strongly urge you to consider using  <strong>private email forwarding</strong> when signing up for new websites in order to protect your confidential information.</div>

          <div class="mb-3">Sincerely,</div>
